            <h3><strong>SCI 010L:</strong> The Codes of Life</h3>
            <p>
                This course explores contemporary challenges in human health and the life sciences 
                using a combination of laboratory and computational methods. Examples of the topics 
                that may be explored include the prevalence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria in 
                our local water systems, the use of genetic engineering to eliminate certain diseases, 
                and the evolutionary origins of modern humans. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Students will learn foundational principles in the sciences, experimental methods, 
                as well as data science and computer science concepts for scientific insight, 
                including Python programming. The course will also explore the connections of 
                science to society, including ethics and policy issues. No prior science or computing 
                experience is expected.

            <h3><strong>SCI 196:</strong> Integrated Science Research</h3>
            <p>
                In this 0.25-credit course, students will gain experience working independently 
                on an Integrated Sciences research experience, which may involve field, laboratory, 
                or computational research (or any combination thereof) and will be mentored by a 
                KDIS faculty member. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The format and expectations of the research will be mutually agreed upon at the 
                start of the semester and must include an end-of-semester deliverable 
                (e.g., reflection paper, oral or poster presentation, lab notebook, dataset, etc.). 
                This course is a 0.25-credit course with a minimum of a 3-hour commitment each week. 
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Permission of instructor.

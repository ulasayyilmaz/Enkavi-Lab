                <p class="full-description">I recently graduated from Pomona College with a Computer Science degree, 
                    bringing rich computational neuroscience research experience, primarily working 
                    with biorealistic modeling using neural networks. I am from Turkey, and I hope to 
                    use my CS degree to better understand the brain. I previously founded and captained 
                    the All-Gender Volleyball Club at the Claremont Colleges, worked in career counseling, 
                    led the Turkish Student Association, and mentored for the International Student 
                    Mentorship Group. Off work hours, you’ll find me biking, playing volleyball, 
                    or reading a book on a piece of grass anywhere around Claremont.</p>

                <p class="full-description">Hi everyone, I am a research assistant at Enkavi Lab. While I study economics, 
                    finance, and data science, I prefer to keep my research focused on the 
                    organ that drives
                    the decision-making behind all—the brain. Luckily, working in a decision 
                    neuroscience lab allows me to do just that. Besides academics, I perform 
                    classical piano (founded the Piano Tuning and Repair Club), meticulously 
                    network (as we all should), and make trips to the Hub after my Ath shift
                        even though I shouldn’t. After graduation, I hope to do wealth management, 
                        but who knows, maybe I’ll decide otherwise.</p>
